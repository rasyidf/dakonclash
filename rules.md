**Enhanced Dakon Clash Rules**  
*(Incorporating strategic first moves, territory control, and balanced explosions)*  

---

### **New/Revised Rules**  

#### **1. First Move Setup**  
- **First Turn Advantage**: On their **very first turn**, each player:  
  - Places **3 beads** (instead of 1) into **any non-center cell** (claiming it as their territory).  
  - *Restriction*: Cannot choose the **central 2x2 area** (e.g., cells (3,3), (3,4), (4,3), (4,4) in a 6x6 grid).  
  - *No immediate overflow*: The cell holds 3 beads (exactly at threshold).  

#### **2. Territory Restrictions**  
- **Ownership Lock**: After the first turn, players **can only place beads into cells they own**.  
  - *Exception*: Chain reactions can still convert neutral or opponent cells (see below).  

#### **3. Overflow & Conversion (Revised)**  
- **Overflow Trigger**: A cell overflows when beads **exceed** the threshold (still 3 beads).  
  - Example: Adding 1 bead to a 3-bead cell (now 4 beads) triggers overflow.  
- **Post-Overflow Ownership**:  
  - The overflowing cell becomes **neutral** after bursting.  
  - **Convert Adjacent Cells**: Any cell receiving beads (even opponent-owned) becomes **your color**.  

#### **4. Chain Reaction Priority**  
- **Resolve Immediately**: Overflows cascade until no cell exceeds the threshold.  
  - Chains follow turn order: If multiple cells overflow, resolve the **newest overflow first**.

### **Example Turn Flow**  
1. **Player A’s First Turn**:  
   - Places 3 beads in a corner cell (non-center), claiming it.  
2. **Player B’s First Turn**:  
   - Places 3 beads in another corner, claiming their territory.  
3. **Subsequent Turns**:  
   - Players add 1 bead to **their own cells**, strategically aiming to trigger overflows.  
   - Example: Player A adds 1 bead to their corner cell (now 4 beads), causing:  
     - Cell bursts, becomes neutral.  
     - 1 bead sent to each adjacent cell (now Player A’s color).  
     - If a newly converted cell reaches 4 beads, it bursts too.

### **Why This Works**  
- **Prevents Early Chaos**: Restricting first moves to non-center cells avoids instant mid-board dominance.  
- **Balanced Aggression**: Players expand via chain reactions, not direct placement, rewarding foresight.  
- **Ownership Matters**: Defending your territory becomes critical—losing a cell to overflow weakens your position.  
- **Dynamic Mid-Game**: The center becomes a contested zone as players’ chain reactions collide.

### **Victory Adjustments**  
- **Endgame**: If no player controls >50% of cells after 10 turns per player, tally **owned cells + total beads** (owned cells prioritized).
