# Bead Clash Game

Bead Clash is a turn-based strategy game built with React. Players take turns placing beads on a 5x5 grid, with each bead affecting the surrounding cells by spreading in four directions (up, down, left, right). The goal is to control the grid by strategically placing and spreading beads of different colors.
